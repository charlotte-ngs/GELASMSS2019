## Problem 1: Model Selection
We assume that we have a dataset for the response variable `carcass weight` (CW) and for some predictor variables

* sex (`sex`)
* slaughterhouse (`slh`)
* herd (`hrd`)
* age at slaughter (`age`)
* day of month when animal was slaughtered (`day`) and
* humidity (`hum`)

Use a fixed linear effects model and determine which of the predictor variables are important for the response. 

The data is available from `data_bp_w09.csv`. 

### Hint
* Use the function `lm` in R to fit the fixed linear effects model


### Solution

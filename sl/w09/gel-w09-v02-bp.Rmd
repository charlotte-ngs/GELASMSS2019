```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::knit_hooks$set(hook_convert_odg = rmddochelper::hook_convert_odg)
```



## Three Steps

The following steps are needed to implement a breeding program

1. description of production system
2. modelling profit of a typical herd
3. derive economic values


## Production System

```{r implbp-prodsys, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/implbp-prodsys.png")
```
 

## Why Production System

* Assume a hierarchical structure of the breeding program
* Alternatively: mixed farms in monolithic structure
* Breeding (and possibly multiplier) farms are selling their progeny to production farms
* Progeny must meet needs of production farms
* Breeders must select parents such that optimal progeny produced for production farms


## Example Of Typical Production Farm

```{r example-prodfarm, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/example-prodfarm.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/example-prodfarm.png")
```


## Traits Of Interest

* Profit ($P$) of production farm determined by revenues ($R$) and costs ($C$)

$$P = R - C$$

* Traits of economic interest influnece $P$
* Restrict ourselves to output 
    + age corrected carcass weight (CW)
    + carcass confirmation (CC)
    + carcass fat (CF)
* Above traits will be included in aggregate genotype ($H$)

$$H = a^T \cdot u$$


## Economic Evaluation

$\rightarrow$ postponed to later


## Genetic Evaluation

* In most cases, two steps plus preparation
* Given: dataset on breeding animals containing traits of interest as response variables and predictor variables
* Preparation: do model selection to eliminate unimportant predictor variables
* Steps:
    1. variance components estimation
    2. prediction of breeding values

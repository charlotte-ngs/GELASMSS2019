## Excursion
* Date: 13.05.2019
* Time: 07:45 - 10
* Topics
    + Lucas Casanova: Braunvieh Schweiz
    + JÃ¼rg Moll: Qualitas AG


## Course Objectives

The students 

* understand the theoretical background and the practical application of the prediction of breeding values in Swiss cattle breeding, in pigs, sheeps and goats. 
* know how to interpret predicted breeding values.

$\rightarrow$ What is the meaning of a predicted breeding value of $-900$ kg for milk yield

$\rightarrow$ What is the difference between production and breeding


## Further Reading
* Willam und Simianer: Tierzucht - Grundwissen Bachelor (Ulmer, UTB 3526 2011). This book gives an introduction into evolution, livestock production and breeding programs.
* Falconer and Mackay: Introduction to Quantitative Genetics (Longman). The de-facto standard in the area of quantitative genetics uses many examples from experimental research to illustrate the concepts of quantitative genetics.
* Mrode: Linear Models for the Prediction of Animal Breeding Values (CABI Publishing, 2005). The main focus is on prediction of breeding values using different models.


## Terminology
* Livestock breeding versus animal husbandry: no difference made
* Breeding (in German: _Zucht_) used in different contexts with different meanings
* Science: 

> "Selection and Mating of parents are used such that offspring generations are closer to a defined goal."

* Distinction between 
    + livestock breeding and production
    + cattle breeding and milk or beef production
    + pig breeding and pork production and 
    + chicken breeding and egg producers


## History
* Formations of breeding organisation (BO)
* Tasks of BO: herdbooks and certification
* Crisis at beginning of $20^{th}$ century lead to federal regulations
* Developments of technologies
    + Reproduction
    + Molecular biology
    + Computer science
    
    
## Breeding Organisations

```{r breedingassociation, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.pos='H'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/breedingassociation.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/breedingassociation.png")
```


## Breeding Programs

```{r bprogdiag, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", fig.pos='H'}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/bprogdiag.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/bprogdiag.png")
```


## Parts of Breeding Program

* Applied prediction of breeding values is a part of the breeding program
* Design and planning of a breeding program requires to answer the questions
    + What goal do we want to achieve
    + What measures do we want to use to achieve the goal
    
    
## Types of Breeding Programs

Two types of breeding programs

1. Focus on __selection response__
    + countries with limited resources
    + big farms or big companies
2. Focus on clients and services
    + cattle and pig breeding of developed countries
    + economic interest of companies and farms


## Breeding Goals
Types of breeding goals

* economic
* biological
* tactical
* ethical

Breeding goals might be formulated in different ways

* __political__: description of idealized image of future animal. Often conflicting and not verifiable
* __scientific__: mathematical description of direction of desired change. Measurable via selection response



## Performance Testing

* Basic question: What trait is measured when for which animals
* Breeding should be based on data
* Quality of derived parameters (heritability, predicted breeding values) depend on accuracy of collected data
* Data collection used for performance testing often started for different reasons
    + milk sample testing: quality of product
    + station testing in pigs: correction of environment
    
    
## Classification of Performance Tests
* Place
    + Station
    + Field
* Relationship between selection candidate and tested animal
    + own performance record
    + full-sib
    + progeny
* Traits
    + should have genetic variation
    + economic importance
    + measurable better than subjectively observed
    
    
## Examples: Pigs

```{r pigperftest, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic("odg/pigperftest.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/pigperftest.png")
```


## Examples: Cattle

```{r cattleperftest, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/cattleperftest.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/cattleperftest.png")
```



## Prediction Of Breeding Values
* Done in most breeding programs
* Federal regulation
* Performance tests much more expensive
* Different intervals
    + cattle: three times per year
    + pigs: nightly or weekly
    
    
## Progress In Technologies
* Reproduction - AI
    + disease prevention
    + number of progeny per sire increased
    + better comparisons between herds
    + Future: more development on female side
* Molecular Biology
    + cheap and efficient large-scale genotyping
    + sequencing with more accuracy
* Computer Science
    + efficient evaluation of large amounts of data
    + big data technologies - continuous monitoring
    
    
## Differences Of BP Between Species

Breeding programs (BP) for different species have different structure

* __hierarchical__: pigs and chicken
* __flat__: cattle and horse


## Hierarchical Structure

```{r HierarchischeZuchtstruktur,echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}

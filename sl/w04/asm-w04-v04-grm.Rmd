## Background
* Breeding value model uses genomic breeding values $g$ as random effects
* Variance-covariance matrix of $g$ are proposed to be proportional to matrix $G$

$$var(g) = G * \sigma_g^2$$

where $G$ is called __genomic relationship matrix__ (GRM)
 

## Properties of $G$
* genomic breeding values $g$ are linear combinations of $q$
* $g$ as deviations, that means $E(g) = 0$
* $var(g)$ as product between $G$ and $\sigma_g^2$ where $G$ is the genomic relationship matrix
* $G$ should be similar to $A$


## Change of Identity Concept
* $A$ is based on identity by descent
* $G$ is based on identity by state (including ibd), assuming that the same allele has the same effect
* IBS can only be observed with SNP-genotype data


## Identity
```{r ibdvsibs, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/ibdvsibs.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/ibdvsibs.png")
```
 

## Linear Combination
* SNP marker effects ($a$ values) from marker effect model are in vector $q$
* Genomic breeding values from breeding value model are determined by

$$g = U \cdot q$$

* Matrix $U$ is determined by desired properties of $g$


## Deviation
* Genomic breeding values are defined as deviation from a certain basis

$\rightarrow$ $E(g) = 0$

* How to determine matrix $U$ such that $E(g) = 0$


## Equivalence Between Models
Decomposition of phenotypic observation $y_i$ with 

* Marker effect model

$$y_i = w_i^T \cdot q + e_i$$

* Breeding value model

$$y_i = g_i + e_i$$

* $g_i$ and $w_i^T \cdot q$ represent the same genetic effects and should be equivalent in terms of variability


## Expected Values
* Required: $E(g_i) = 0$
* But: $E(w_i^T \cdot q) = q^T \cdot E(w_i)$
* Take $q$ as constant SNP effects
* Assume $w_i$ to be the random variable with:

\begin{equation}
w_i = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{lll} 
  1   &  \text{ with probability }  &  p^2 \\
  0   &  \text{ with probability }  &  2p(1-p) \\
  -1  &  \text{ with probability }  &  (1-p)^2
  \end{array}
\right. \notag
\end{equation}

$\rightarrow E(w_i):$ For a single locus

$$E(w_i) = 1 * p^2 + 0 * 2p(1-p) + (-1)(1-p)^2 = p^2 - 1 + 2p - p^2 = 2p - 1 \ne 0$$

## Specification of $g$
* Set

$$g_i = (w_i^T - s_i^T) \cdot q$$
with $s_i = E(w_i) = 2p-1$

* Resulting in 

$$g = U \cdot q = (W-S)\cdot q$$
with matrix $S$ having columns $j$ with all elements equal to $2p_j-1$ where $p_j$ is the allele frequency of the SNP allele associated with the positive effect.


## Genetic Variance

* Requirement: $var(g) = G * \sigma_g^2$
* Result from Gianola et al. (2009): 

$$\sigma_g^2 = \sigma_q^2 * \sum_{j=1}^k(1-2p_j(1-p_j))$$

* From earlier: $g = U \cdot q$

$$var(g) = var(U \cdot q) = U \cdot var(q) \cdot U^T = UU^T \sigma_q^2$$

* Combining

$$var(g) = UU^T \sigma_q^2 = G * \sigma_q^2 * \sum_{j=1}^k(1-2p_j(1-p_j))$$


## Genomic Relationship Matrix

$$G = \frac{UU^T}{\sum_{j=1}^k(1-2p_j(1-p_j))}$$


## How To Compute $G$
* Read matrix $W$ 
* For each column $j$ of $W$ compute frequency $p_j$
* Compute matrix $S$ and $\sum_{j=1}^k(1-2p_j(1-p_j))$ from $p_j$
* Compute $U$ from $W$ and $S$
* Compute $G$

```

## Background
- Given a population of $N$ animals
- Each animal has information on genotypes at loci $G$, $H$ and $I$
- Each animal has an observation for one quantitative trait of interest $y$
- __Goal__: Predict genomic breeding values


## Data
```{r datastucturegbv, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/datastucturegbv.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/datastucturegbv.png")
```


## Two Types Of Models

1. __Genetic__ Model: How can we decompose the phenotype into genetic part and non-genetic environmental part
2. __Statistical__ Model: How to estimate unknown parameters from a dataset

__Goals__: 

1. Use genetic model to show how observations and genetic information can be used to predict breeding values.
2. Use statistical techniques to do the prediction


## Genetic Model

- simple model from quantitative genetics to split phenotypic observation into 
    + genetic part $g$ and
    + environmental part $e$
    
$$y = g + e$$
    
- environment: split into
    + known environmental factors: `herd`, `year`, ... ($\beta$)
    + unknown random error ($\epsilon$)
    
- polygenic model: use a finite number of loci to model genetic part of phenotypic observation


## Genetic Model (II)

```{r geneticmodeldiagram, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/geneticmodeldiagram.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/geneticmodeldiagram.png")
```

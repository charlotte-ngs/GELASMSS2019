## Background
- Given a population of $N$ animals
- Each animal has information on genotypes at loci $G$, $H$ and $I$
- Each animal has an observation for one quantitative trait of interest $y$
- __Goal__: Predict genomic breeding values


## Data
```{r datastucturegbv, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/datastucturegbv.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/datastucturegbv.png")
```


## Two Types Of Models

1. __Genetic__ Model: How can we decompose the phenotype into genetic part and non-genetic environmental part
2. __Statistical__ Model: How to estimate unknown parameters from a dataset

__Goals__: 

1. Use genetic model to show how observations and genetic information can be used to predict breeding values.
2. Use statistical techniques to do the prediction


## Genetic Model

- simple model from quantitative genetics to split phenotypic observation into 
    + genetic part $g$ and
    + environmental part $e$
    
$$y = g + e$$
    
- environment: split into
    + known environmental factors: `herd`, `year`, ... ($\beta$)
    + unknown random error ($\epsilon$)
    
- polygenic model: use a finite number of loci to model genetic part of phenotypic observation


## Genetic Model (II)

```{r geneticmodeldiagram, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/geneticmodeldiagram.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/geneticmodeldiagram.png")
```
 

## Polygenic Model
- Component $g$ can be decomposed into contributions $g_j$ of single loci

$$g = \sum_{j=1}^k g_j$$

- Assume that loci are additive, hence genotypic values $g_j$ depends on $a_j$ with $d_j = 0$
- Genotypic values at locus $j$ can either be $-a_j$, $0$ or $a_j$
- Breeding values based on locus $j$ depends on $a_j$.


## Genotypic Value
- Genotypic value $g_i$ for animal $i$ over all loci

$$g_i = M_i \cdot a$$

where M_i is a row vector with elements $-1$, $0$ and $1$ and $a$ is the vector of all genotypic values of the positive homozygous genotypes of all loci. 


## Phenotypic Value
- Collecting all components for an observation $y_i$ for animal $i$

$$y_i = W_i \cdot \beta + M_i \cdot a + \epsilon_i$$

- all animals in the population

$$y = W\cdot \beta + M \cdot a + \epsilon$$

- combining $b^T = \left[\begin{array}{cc} \beta & a \end{array} \right]$ and $X = \left[\begin{array}{cc} W & M \end{array} \right]$

$$y = X\cdot b + \epsilon$$


## Statistical Model
- genetic model from statistics point of view
- phenotypic observation as response $y$
- vector $b$ (known environment and genotypic values) as unknown parameter
- fixed predictor variales in matrix $X$
- vector $\epsilon$ as random error terms

$\rightarrow$ Fixed Linear Effects Model


## Parameter Estimation
- use regression model
- regression means both response and predictors are continuous
- example dataset: body weight on breast circumference


## Regression Dataset

```{r dataregression, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
tbl_reg <- tibble::tibble(Animal = c(1:10),
                          `Breast Circumference` = c(176, 177, 178, 179, 179, 180, 181, 182,183, 184),
                          `Body Weight` = c(471, 463, 481, 470, 496, 491, 518, 511, 510, 541))
knitr::kable(tbl_reg)
```


## Regression Model

- response $y$: body weight
- predictor $x$: breast circumference
- model for observation $y_i$

$$y_i = x_i * b + \epsilon_i$$

- meaning of $b$: change $x_i$ by one unit $\rightarrow$ $y_i$ changes on average by $b$ units.
- use case: measure $x_{N+1}$ for animal $N+1$ with unknown weight and use $b$ to predict $y_{N+1}$


## Least Squares
- How to find $b$ such that $y$ is best approximated by $x$
- Residuals $r_i = y_i - x_i * b$
- Minimization of sum of squared residuals ($SSQ_R$)
- Use $\hat{b}$ at minimal $SSQ_R$ as estimate

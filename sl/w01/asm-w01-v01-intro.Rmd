## Administration

- Course: 2 hours of lecture (2 V)
- Plan: 2 V $\rightarrow$ 1 U + 1V (1 hour of exercise and 1 hour of lecture) 
- Exercises: Work on problems in R 
- Material: course notes, slides, solution to exercises
- Exam: written, date: 27.05.2019, 08:15-09:00 


## Objectives

The students 

- are familiar with the properties of __fixed linear effects models__
- are able to analyse simple data sets
- know why least squares cannot be used for genomic selection. 
- know the statistical methods used in genomic selection, such as 
    + BLUP-based approaches, 
    + Bayesian procedures and 
    + LASSO. 
- are able to solve simple exercise problems using the statistical framework R.


## Program

```{r CourseSetup, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# define course start date
dCourseStart <- as.Date("2019/02/18")
# set number of weeks in semester
nNrSemesterWeeks <- 6
# define columns for weaks and dates which remain constant
Woche <- 1:nNrSemesterWeeks
Datum <- format(seq(dCourseStart, by = "week", length.out = nNrSemesterWeeks), "%d.%m")
# empty vector for topics
vec_topics <- vector(mode = "character", length = nNrSemesterWeeks)
vec_topics_schedule <- vec_topics
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/02/18"), "%d.%m"))] <- "Introduction"
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/02/25"), "%d.%m"))] <- "Fixed Linear Effects Models"
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/03/04"), "%d.%m"))] <- "GBLUP - Marker-Effects Models"
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/03/11"), "%d.%m"))] <- "GBLUP - Breeding Value Models"
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/03/18"), "%d.%m"))] <- "Lasso"
vec_topics_schedule[which(Datum == format(as.Date("2019/03/25"), "%d.%m"))] <- "Bayesian Approaches"

dfSlideTable <- tibble::tibble(Woche = Woche, Datum = Datum, Thema = vec_topics_schedule) 
knitr::kable(dfSlideTable)

## This Course

- Use dataset that is used to predict genomic breeding values and introduce four methods

1. Fixed Linear Effects Models - Least Squares
2. GBLUP - genomic version of BLUP
3. LASSO - still fixed linear effects model, but modified parameter estimation
4. Bayesian approach to estimate unknown parameter


## Significance

- Why is this important? 
- Is this only relevant for animal breeding? 
- What about the rest of animal science?

- General trend of collecting data has led to development of `Big Data`
- Examples
    + Presidential campains in the US
    + Health care
    + Agriculture: Smart Farming
    + Animal Science


## Traditional Animal Breeding

- Before 2006
- Data collected for other purposes were used to predict breeding values
- Predicted breeding values as side-product


## Data Logistics

```{r datalogistics, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/datalogistics.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/datalogistics.png")
```

 
## Genomic Selection

- Same goal as in traditional breeding: Find animals with best genetic potential as parents of next generation
- New: use additional source of information
- __Genomic__ information
    + spread accross whole genome
    + single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)

## SNP

```{r snparchitecture, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/snparchitecture.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/snparchitecture.png")
```
 

## QTL

```{r linkagesnpqtl, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/linkagesnpqtl.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/linkagesnpqtl.png")
```
 

## Linkage

- Flanking SNPs and QTL not independent

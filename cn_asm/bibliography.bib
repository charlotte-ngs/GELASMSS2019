  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (N e 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilib-rium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

  abstract = {Animals can be genotyped for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at one time, where the SNPs are located at roughly 1-cM intervals throughout the genome. For each contiguous pair of SNPs there are four possible haplotypes that could be inherited from the sire. The effects of each interval on a trait can be estimated for all intervals simultaneously in a model where interval effects are random factors. Given the estimated effects of each haplotype for every interval in the genome, and given an animal's genotype, a 'genomic' estimated breeding value is obtained by summing the estimated effects for that genotype. The accuracy of that estimator of breeding values is around 80{\%}. Because the genomic estimated breeding values can be calculated at birth, and because it has a high accuracy, a strategy that utilizes these advantages was compared with a traditional progeny testing strategy under a typical Canadian-like dairy cattle situation. Costs of proving bulls were reduced by 92{\%} and genetic change was increased by a factor of 2. Genome-wide selection may become a popular tool for genetic improvement in livestock.},

  abstract = {Genomic selection using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a powerful new tool for genetic selection. In cattle, SNP profiles for individual animals are generated using a small plastic chip that is diagnostic for up to 50 000 SNPs spaced throughout the genome. Phenotypes, usually averaged over offspring of bulls, are matched with SNP profiles of bulls mathematically so that animals can be ranked for siring desirable phenotypes via their SNP profiles. For many traits in dairy cattle, the rate of genetic improvement can be nearly doubled when SNP information is used in addition to current methods of genetic evaluation. Separate SNP analyses need to be developed for different populations (e.g. the system for Holsteins is not useful for Jerseys). In addition, the value of these systems is very dependent on the number of accurate phenotypes matched with SNP profiles; for example, increasing the number of North American Holstein bulls evaluated from 1151 to 3576 quadrupled the additional genetic gain in net merit from this approach. Thus, the available information will be insufficient to exploit this technology fully for most populations. However, once a valid SNP evaluation system is developed, any animal in that population, including embryos, can be evaluated with similar accuracy. Biopsying embryos and screening them via SNP analysis will greatly enhance the value of this technology by minimising generation intervals. {\textcopyright} 2010 IETS.},

  abstract = {Emphasis on livestock genetic improvement in the past decades has led to commercialization of different breeds of livestock species. Breed validation has become increasingly important to assess the safety and authenticity of livestock products in global and domestic markets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of breed-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in discriminating between Holstein and Jersey dairy cattle breeds. Two separate resource populations were used, including a reference population consisting of 498 Holstein and 83 Jersey bull DNA samples, and a validation population consisting of 260 Holstein and 34 Jersey cow DNA samples. Five Jersey-specific and four Holstein-specific SNPs were identified and genotyped on the reference and validation resource populations. The reference population was used to validate the breed-specific SNPs used in this study and to predict the allocation efficiencies and misclassification probabilities of different combinations of SNPs. Individual animals in the validation population were allocated to either breed based on the presence of breed-specific alleles. It was found that any combination of three breed-specific SNPs had, on average, high breed allocation efficiency of {\textgreater}95{\%} and low misclassification probability of {\textless}5{\%}. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a simple, yet effective, method of using breed-specific SNPs to discriminate between Jersey and Holstein cattle breeds.},

  abstract = {In Bos taurus the universality of the reference genome is biased towards genetic variation represented by only two related individuals representing the same Hereford breed. Therefore, results of genetic analyses based on this reference may not be reliable. The 1000 Bull Genomes resource allows for identification of breed-specific polymorphisms and for the construction of breed-specific reference genomes. Whole-genome sequences or 936 bulls allowed us to construct seven breed specific reference genomes of Bos taurus for Angus, Brown Swiss, Fleckvieh, Hereford, Jersey, Limousin and Simmental. In order to identify breed-specific variants all detected SNPs were filtered within-breed to satisfy criteria of the number of missing genotypes not higher than 7{\%} and the alternative allele frequency equal to unity. The highest number of breed-specific SNPs was identified for Jersey (130,070) and the lowest—for the Simmental breed (197). Such breed-specific polymorphisms were annotated to coding regions overlapping with 78 genes in Angus, 140 in Brown Swiss, 132 in Fleckvieh, 100 in Hereford, 643 in Jersey, 10 in Limousin and no genes in Simmental. For most of the breeds, the majority of breed-specific variants from coding regions was synonymous. However, most of Fleckvieh-specific and Hereford-specific polymorphisms were missense mutations. Since the identified variants are characteristic for the analysed breeds, they form the basis of phenotypic differences observed between them, which result from different breeding programmes. Breed-specific reference genomes can enhance the accuracy of SNP driven inferences such as Genome-wide Association Studies or SNP genotype imputation.},

  abstract = {The mixed linear model employed for genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) includes the breeding value for each animal as a random effect that has a mean of zero and a covariance matrix proportional to the genomic relationship matrix (  G{\_}gg G g g ), where the inverse of  G{\_}gg G g g is required to set up the usual mixed model equations (MME). When only some animals have genomic information, genomic predictions can be obtained by an extension known as single-step GBLUP, where the covariance matrix of breeding values is constructed by combining the pedigree-based additive relationship matrix with  G{\_}gg G g g . The inverse of the combined relationship matrix can be obtained efficiently, provided  G{\_}gg G g g can be inverted. In some livestock species, however, the number N{\_}g N g of animals with genomic information exceeds the number of marker covariates used to compute  G{\_}gg G g g , and this results in a singular  G{\_}gg G g g . For such a case, an efficient and exact method to obtain GBLUP and single-step GBLUP is presented here. Exact methods are already available to obtain GBLUP when  G{\_}gg G g g is singular, but these require working with large dense matrices. Another approach is to modify  G{\_}gg G g g to make it nonsingular by adding a small value to all its diagonals or regressing it towards the pedigree-based relationship matrix. This, however, results in the inverse of  G{\_}gg G g g being dense and difficult to compute as N{\_}g N g grows. The approach presented here recognizes that the number r of linearly independent genomic breeding values cannot exceed the number of marker covariates, and the mixed linear model used here for genomic prediction only fits these r linearly independent breeding values as random effects. The exact method presented here was compared to Apy-GBLUP and to Apy single-step GBLUP, both of which are approximate methods that use a modified  G{\_}gg{\$} G g g that has a sparse inverse which can be computed efficiently. In a small numerical example, predictions from the exact approach and Apy were almost identical, but the MME from Apy had a condition number about 1000 times larger than that from the exact approach, indicating ill-conditioning of the MME from Apy. The practical application of exact SSGBLUP is not more difficult than implementation of Apy.},

  abstract = {Efficient methods for processing genomic data were developed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63{\%} compared with 32{\%} using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3{\%}) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66{\%}. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},

First, relationships between the (Bayesian) variance of marker effects in some regression models and additive genetic variance are examined under standard assumptions. Second, the connection between marker genotypes and resemblance between relatives is explored, and linkages between a marker-based model and the infinitesimal model are reviewed. Third, issues associated with the use of Bayesian models for marker-assisted selection, with a focus on the role of the priors, are examined from a theoretical angle. The sensitivity of a Bayesian specification that has been proposed (called {"}Bayes A{"}) with respect to priors is illustrated with a simulation. Methods that can solve potential shortcomings of some of these Bayesian regression procedures are discussed briefly.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (N e 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilib-rium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in data collection during routine health care in the form of Electronic Health Records (EHR), medical device data (e.g., infusion pump informatics, physiological monitoring data, and insurance claims data, among others, as well as biological and experimental data, have created tremendous opportunities for biological discoveries for clinical application. However, even with all the advancement in technologies and their promises for discoveries, very few research findings have been translated to clinical knowledge, or more importantly, to clinical practice. In this paper, we identify and present the initial work addressing the relevant challenges in three broad categories: data, accessibility, and translation. These issues are discussed in the context of a widely used detailed database from an intensive care unit, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database.},

@Article{Schaeffer2006,
  abstract = {Animals can be genotyped for thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at one time, where the SNPs are located at roughly 1-cM intervals throughout the genome. For each contiguous pair of SNPs there are four possible haplotypes that could be inherited from the sire. The effects of each interval on a trait can be estimated for all intervals simultaneously in a model where interval effects are random factors. Given the estimated effects of each haplotype for every interval in the genome, and given an animal's genotype, a 'genomic' estimated breeding value is obtained by summing the estimated effects for that genotype. The accuracy of that estimator of breeding values is around 80{\%}. Because the genomic estimated breeding values can be calculated at birth, and because it has a high accuracy, a strategy that utilizes these advantages was compared with a traditional progeny testing strategy under a typical Canadian-like dairy cattle situation. Costs of proving bulls were reduced by 92{\%} and genetic change was increased by a factor of 2. Genome-wide selection may become a popular tool for genetic improvement in livestock.},

@Book{Mrode2005,
  abstract = {Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) has become the most widely accepted method for genetic evaluation of domestic livestock. Since the method was first published by Henderson (1949), it has evolved in terms of its application in models for genetic evaluation, from sire, sire and maternal grandsires models in the early years, followed by univariate and multivariate animal models, and more recently to random regression models for the analysis of longitudinal data. Advances in computational methods and computing power have enhanced this development. Currently, most national genetic evaluation systems for several domestic live- stock species are based on animal or random regression models using BLUP.},

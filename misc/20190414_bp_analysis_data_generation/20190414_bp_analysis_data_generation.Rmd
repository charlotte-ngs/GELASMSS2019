# Disclaimer
Exercise 1 in Applied Genetic Evaluation (GEL) does a genetic evaluation of a beef cattle data set. 


# Important Factors
According to the work by Kunz et al (2019) presented at SVT (16.04.2019) important factors for the carcass performance traits are

* sex
* slaughterhouse
* classifier
* age (as linear and quadratic covariable)
* herd * year (as random interaction)


# Factors Used In Simulation
For our data simulation, we use a simplified set of factors consisting of 

* sex
* slaughterhouse
* age as linear covariable
* herd as fixed effect.


# Trait
For reasons of simplicity we are using carcass weight, because it is a continuous trait.
